# PRIORITY
- Ask to generate provinces if a color is present in provinces.png but not definition.csv
- Keep extra title data from the parser not to discard them when exporting
- Keep track of the file in which a title is saved
- Export titles (name, color, capital, landless, dejure titles)
- Add button to change the county capital for duchy, kingdom and empire
- Add button to change barony province id (by clicking on map)
- Add way to change the order of dejure titles to change counties' capital barony
- Add way to focus camera on province or title on map
- Import coastal, island and land flags from files for provinces

# IN FUTURE
- Add console tab with logs, errors...
- Add history for titles
- Improve map drawing to be able to display all kinds of titles at the same time (i.e baronies and d_xxxxx)
- Add button to open .txt file of title / province
- Add button to change a province sea-zone for port
- Improve ExportDefaultMap to use range and not only list

# IDEAS
